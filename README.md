# Turing-Vue

### Intro

The [Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io/) Front-End engineering program trains new developers to become successful Front-End Engineers over 7, intense, months. The FEE program primarily focuses on JavaScript with an emphasis on the React/Redux ecosystem. I recently embarked on the task of teaching myself Vue.js and thought that recreating the projects I'd completed at Turing, in Vue, would be an excellent way to compare and contrast. I thought these projects might serve other students and wanted to make them available to all.

### Approach

All projects are started from the Vue-cli as the emphasis, for me, is on learning the framework rather than the tooling. At some point I may add a _Boilerplate_ section to house my own base configs.

I tried to take a straight-forward, spec-driven approach to the project. Where the spec is broken out into steps or phases, I created branches for each to try to help outline the approach taken.

### Testing

Currently the projects have few to no tests written, this will be updated in the future.

### Mod-1 projects:

#### Number Guesser:

* A simple guessing game that teaches students about handling inputs and manipulating the DOM.

#### Linked List

* An app for bookmarking links originally intended to give students more practice with jQuery. Here we are using the project to get more exposure to working with the DOM in Vue, iterating over arrays of objects and working with computed properties.

#### Foto Viewer

* An app, similar to linked list, not currently being used by the stuents at Turing School. I used this project simply to practice and solidify concepts already learned in previous projects.

#### Idea Box

* A place to store some ideas. Originally meant to teach students about working with data structures and persisting/loading data from LocalStorage. This project is a good intro to breaking a Vue application into small components.

#### 2do Box Pivot

* A Todo list app, built from Idea Box. Originally intended to show students what it's like to pivot an existing project, refactor and add additional functionality. This project was good practice for working with components and managing different views based on filtering and computed properties.
